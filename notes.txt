1. Refactor get_print_tweets to handle flexibility - print fast or just gather data.
  - Pull print functions out into separate methods

2. Fix long argument strings => hashes

3. Write update method to grab new tweets

4. status[:retweeted_status][:id] -- ID of original tweet. Would need to be saved in object. More rigorous.
   status[:retweeted_status][:text] -- Text of original tweet.
